This repository contains my solution for the MLOps major exam assignment. It demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow using Linear Regression, including training, quantization, Docker setup, CI pipeline, and testing.

---

##  Project Overview

-  Model training and evaluation using `scikit-learn`
-  Model quantization by manually converting coefficients to `uint8`
-  Docker containerization for easy deployment
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and reproducibility
